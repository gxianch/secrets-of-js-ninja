<!-- Testing functional scope -->
<!--
This series of tests proves the following rules about functional scope:
- Named functions are in scope from anywhere within the scope in which they
  are declared (sometimes called hoisting)
- Variables are not hoisted. Rather they are in scope from the point
  at which they are declared
- Therefore we can say that functions can be forward referenced
  in their scope  but varibles can't
- For the purpose of scope declaration, the global scope acts as one
  encompassing function that wraps the code on the page
- Note: This code produces some failing tests for illustration purposes
